In this folder are the scripts to run the processing, viewing and analysis of the data.
All assume that the spectral data are present in the folder data/ in the working directory.
Check each script for further implicit assumptions and adjust according to your needs.
These scripts are not function, they call the functions present in the package to run the analyses.
